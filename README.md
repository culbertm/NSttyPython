# NaStty Python
## What is it?
Allows for using NetScaler CLI commands natively without the need to 
mess with Nitro API. Simply login, type commands, and off you go. NStty
Python can also be used to save NetScaler CLI commands as scripts that
can be exported and imported allowing for remote automation of a 
NetScaler enviornment.
## Why is it?
The Nitro API can be cumbersome to those sysadmins who just want to use
the functionality of the NetScaler through the API, but don't want to 
be forced to learn programming for REST APIs, json, and the myriad of 
other caveats that come with using Nitro. If you know how to use the 
CLI, you will know how to use NaStty Python.
